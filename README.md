Fully connected neural network to solve the mnist hand written digits problem.
Different approaches and packages have been used.

*Neural network using numpy.
*ANN using torch library in lua.
*ANN using theano.
*Neural net with keras , with theano back end.
*Neural net using pybrain (now deprecated). 

The accuracy reaches around .96-.97, when standard packages from torch,keras,pybrain and theano are used.
Else it is around .80 using the network built from numpy.
